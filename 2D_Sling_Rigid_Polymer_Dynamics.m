% To simulate the dynamics of a rigid polymer by Sling model

trial = 1; % training
twist = 100; % change of state
node = 8; % nodes of rigid polymer

angle = 0.02; % in rad, angle changed in each twist
L = 1; % length of each segment of rigid polymer
a = 10; % threshold to form loop

Hc = 1.0 % energy level of cis rigid configuration
Ht = 0.9 % energy level of trans rigid configuration
